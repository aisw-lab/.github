<br>
<h4>1. LLM</h4>
First, we are studying how to effectively process LLM Agents by applying the concept of multi-agents and continuous learning of various external data using techniques such as RAG.
<br>
<h4>2. Local LLM</h4>
Secondly, We are conducting research on Local LLM in intranet environment using Llama 3.1 Instruct lightweight model.
In a corporate environment, we are researching a system that can use AI in an internal environment to suit corporate circumstances due to security issues.
<br>
<h4>3. IoT</h4>
Thirdly, We perform software development and PCB design using Arduino based on microprocessors such as Atmega328 and Atmega2560.
<br>
<h4>4. Deep learning</h4>
Fourthly, through research on Object Detection, we explore topics such as object recognition, autonomous driving (object detection), disaster prevention, and car speed measurement. We explore topics like data augmentation with deep learning and generative AI.
